                        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MANIT follows a three examination policy, which consists of a mini test, a mid term and an end term. Mini test has a weightage of 10%, Mid term of 20% and end term of 60%. Remaining 10% weightage is given to attendance, assignments or projects (depending upon the professor).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The mini test is conducted in the first month of the semester. Mid term in October and March and end term in November and April in odd and even semesters respectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MANIT follows a relative grading scheme. Pointer is calculated by dividing student's score with the highest score multiplied by 10, fetching the top scorer 10 pointer. Thus, MANIT follows a 10 point grading system where a student's Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) is the average of its pointer in individual courses.</p>

                        <p>MANIT has 10 hostels and an Energy Centre to accommodate the freshmen. All the hostels have basic facilities of 24&times;7 running tap water, LAN connection, geysers etc. Following is a list of all the hostels:-&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>BOYS HOSTEL:</p>

                        <p>There is no specific criteria for allotment of hostels to freshmen. They get the hostel as soon as they fill the Hostel Allotment Form and pay the Mess Fees.</p>
                        <p>First year boys are alloted either Hostel No 1 or Hostel No 2 or Energy Centre. They have to leave their respective hostels after completing first year. They then will have to shift to senior boys hostels as per allotted by authorities.</p>
                        <p>Girls have to live in Hostel No 7 for the coming 4 years. But they also have to leave first year block and shift to senior blocks after completing first year within Hostel No 7's premises.</p>

                    <div id="faq2" class="faq-content">
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MANIT follows pretty good system for allotting rooms to freshmen. Hostel Authority randomly allot the rooms and the roommates are decided in order of their registration in the hostel. Generally 4 people have to share one room alongwith cupboards. In rare cases, it may be 3 people sharing one room. The reason to adopt this system is that the students should interact more with their roommates and other new students. It is helpful for one gets to know his/her batchmate. Learn other's culture and language ,if they belong to some other state or country. Moreover, it helps cultivate new bonds of friendship</p>

                    <a class="faq-section-title" href="#faq12">How about cleanliness and organisation of the room? How frequently is the room cleaned by the sweepers?</a>
                    <div id="faq12" class="faq-content">
                        <p>When the hostel is first alloted to the students, they get a neat and tidy room to live in with beds and cupboards properly arranged. Later they can change the orientation of the beds as per convenience.</p>
                        <p>Further on, for the cleanliness of the room they can follow the following ways:&nbsp;</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>They can contribute to buy a broom and clean the room on their own. They can ask other roommates to broom and mop the room turn by turn.</li>
                        <li>This will inculcate the good habit of keeping one's place clean and tidy in the long run. It&nbsp; is necessary for a student because a clean place helps the student to concentrate better on their studies.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li>They can ask the sweepers of the hostel to clean the room once or twice a week. For this, they can decide on a minimum wage to be paid to the sweeper for cleaning the room.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes sense to wait a couple of days for the professor to specify which books they will be following. Although, hardly any changes are there and you can ask your seniors which books to recommend.</p>
                        <p>Here are the ways to get text books:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>They are issued at the institute library after your card is issued. You can get the form online and submit it with your photograph and admission card to get your library card.</li>
                        <li>There is a book bank at MANIT. You can issue twice from it per year. Books are issued for a semester's duration. Issuing books from book bank requires form fillings each year. Priority on the basis of category is given. (SC/ST &gt;OBC &gt; GEN)</li>
                        <li>You may also borrow books from seniors or purchase from them at half rate. Seniors are usually keen to give out books.</li>
                        <li>You may purchase books from the retailers from local market of Bhopal. They follow a return policy and refund some amount on returning books after a semester is over.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div id="faq5" class="faq-content">
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MANIT encourages meritorious students by offering the option of a change of department at the end of first year. It depends upon the number of seats available in the quota through which you took admission. This requires a good CGPA at the end of 2nd semester.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, you must understand that only a handful of students can get a department change, so don't bank upon getting one and choose a department in which you could plan your career.</p>

                    <div id="faq6" class="faq-content">
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of study one has to put in varies from individual to individual. Professors cover all the important topics in their lectures, studying from their notes can fetch you decent marks, but that requires regular attendance.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are aiming for a department change, you probably will have to study a bit more than you usually would.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life at NIT is not just about academic excellence but about overall development. There are many workshops held every weekend and various events organised by different societies, in which you must participate.</p>
