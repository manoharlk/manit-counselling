                        <p>MANIT follows a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">three</span> examination policy, which consists of a mini test, a mid term and an end term. Mini test has a weightage of 10%, Mid term of 20% and end term of 60%. Remaining 10% weightage is given to attendance, assignments or projects <em>(depending upon the professor). </em></p>
<p>The mini test is conducted in the first month of the semester. Mid term in October and March and end term in November and April in odd and even semesters respectively.</p>
<p>MANIT follows a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">relative</span> grading scheme. Pointer is calculated by dividing student's score with the highest score multiplied by 10, fetching the top scorer 10 pointer. Thus, MANIT follows a 10 point grading system where a student's Semester Grade Point Average (<strong>SGPA</strong>) is the average of its pointer in individual subjects.</p> </div>

                    <div id="faq11" class="faq-content">
                        <p>MANIT has 10 hostels and an Energy Centre to accommodate the freshmen. All the hostels have basic facilities of 24&times;7 running tap water, LAN connection, geysers etc. Following is a list of all the hostels:-&nbsp;</p>
<p>BOYS HOSTEL:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hostel No. 1: Homi Jehangir Bhabha Bhawan</li>
<li>Hostel No 2: Vikram Sarabhai Bhawan</li>
<li>Hostel No 3: A.P. Kanivide Bhawan</li>
<li>Hostel No 4: Chandrashekhar Venkat Raman Bhawan</li>
<li>Hostel No 5 : Mokshagundam Visvesvarayya Bhawan</li>
<li>Hostel No 6 : Jagdish Chandra Bhawan</li>
<li>Hostel No 8: Ramanujan Bhawan</li>
<li>NRI Hostel: Raja Ramanna Bhawan</li>
<li>Energy Centre&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>GIRLS HOSTEL:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hostel No 7: Kalpana Chawla Bhawan&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no specific criteria for allotment of hostels to freshmen. Hostel is allotted as soon as they fill the Hostel Allotment Form and pay the Mess Fees.</p>
<p>First year boys are allotted either Hostel No 1 or Hostel No 2 or Energy Centre. After completing first year, they then will shift to senior boys&rsquo; hostels as per allotment by authorities.</p>
<p>Girls have to reside in Hostel No 7 for the coming 4 years. But they will also have to shift from first year block to senior blocks within Hostel No 7's premises after completing first year.</p></div>

                    <a class="faq-section-title" href="#faq2">How does the system of allotment of rooms to freshmen work?</a>
                    <div id="faq2" class="faq-content">
                        <p >MANIT follows a pretty good system for allotting rooms to freshmen. Hostel Authorities randomly allot the rooms and the roommates are decided in order of their registration in the hostel. Generally 4 people have to share one room along with cupboards. In rare cases, there may be 3 people sharing one room. The reason to adopt this system is that the students should interact more with their roommates and other new students. It is helpful if one gets to know his/her batch mate and learn other cultures and languages.</p>
<p>Moreover, it helps cultivate new bonds of friendship.</p></div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-section">
                    <a class="faq-section-title" href="#faq12">How about cleanliness and organisation of the room? How frequently is the room cleaned by the sweepers?</a>
                    <div id="faq12" class="faq-content">
                        <p>When the hostel is first allotted to the students, they get a neat and tidy room to live in with beds and cupboards properly arranged. Later they can change the orientation of the beds as per their convenience.</p>
<p>For the cleanliness of the room they may follow the following ways:</p>
<p>1) They can contribute to buy a broom and clean the room on their own. Sweeping and mopping of the room can be done taking turns.</p>
<p>This, in the long run will inculcate a good habit of keeping one's place clean and tidy. It is necessary for a student because clean surroundings help the student concentrate on studies.</p>
<p>2) They can ask the sweepers of the hostel to clean the room once or twice a week. For this, they can decide on a minimal wage to be paid to the sweeper for cleaning the room.</p></div>

                    <div id="faq4" class="faq-content">
                        <p>It makes sense to wait a couple of days for the professor to specify which books they will be following. You can also ask your seniors which books to refer to.</p>
<p>Here are the ways to get text books:</p>
<p>1) They are issued at the institute library after your library card is issued. You can get the form online and submit it with your photograph and admission card to get your library card.</p>
<p>2) There is a book bank in MANIT. You can get books issued twice per year. Books are issued for a semester's duration. Issuing books from the book bank requires form fillings each year. Priority on the basis of category is given. (SC/ST &gt;OBC &gt; GEN)</p>
<p>3) You may also borrow books from seniors or purchase from them at a mutually agreed upon rate.</p>
<p>4) You may purchase books from retailers from the local market of Bhopal. They follow a return policy and refund some amount on returning books after a semester is over.</p></div>

                    <div id="faq5" class="faq-content">
                        <p>MANIT encourages meritorious students by offering the option of a change of department at the end of first year. It depends upon the number of seats available in the quota through which you took admission. This requires a good CGPA at the end of 2nd semester.</p>
<p>However, you must understand that only a handful of students can get a department change, so don't bank upon getting one and choose a department in which you could plan your career.</p></div>

                    <div id="faq6" class="faq-content">
                        <p>The amount of study one has to put in varies from <em>individual to individual.</em></p>
<p>Professors cover all the important topics in their lectures, studying from their notes can fetch you decent marks, but that requires regular attendance.</p>
<p>If you are aiming for a department change, you probably will have to study a little more than you usually would.</p>
<p>Life at NIT is not just about academic excellence but also about overall development. There are many workshops held every weekend and various events organised by different societies, in which you can participate.</p></div>

                        <p>MANIT works on the principle of junior-senior bonding.&nbsp; If students have a good rapport with the seniors, then they should consider themselves to be lucky. In MANIT if you prove yourself to be a good junior then chances are that your senior will end up being a good friend of yours. Get to know about it MANIT has got a 'Treat Culture'. And you will also get to know it, if you will be willing enough to work for your senior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the question that if some senior approaches you, then no need to worry. It may be :-</p>
<p>a) that the senior just wants to know you better.</p>
<p>b) Also, in some cases, senior may approach you to seek some help in completing their work. It is all upto you if you want to accept or decline the offer. Whatever you feel like doing, just do it politely.</p>
<p>Because they are your seniors, so they deserve some respect from you. Just show your respect to them and there is no need to worry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many times the seniors will have meeting with you. It would be beneficial for you to attend it as you will get a chance to interact with your seniors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case u feel that the senior is not behaving properly, you can politely point out that you are not comfortable. Don't ever be afraid of speaking against ragging. Because if any senior is doing so, just don't hesitate to call Anti-ragging Cell and help will be given to you.</p></div>
