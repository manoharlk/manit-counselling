                There is no specific criteria for allotment of hostels to freshmen. They get the hostel as soon as they fill the Hostel Allotment Form and pay the Mess Fees.
                First year boys are alloted either Hostel No 1 or Hostel No 2 or Energy Centre. They have to leave their respective hostels after completing first year. They then will have to shift to senior boys hostels as per allotted by authorities. 
                Girls have to live in Hostel No 7 for the coming 4 years. But they also have to leave first year block and shift to senior blocks after completing first year within Hostel No 7's premises.</p>

            <a class="faq-section-title" href="#faq2">How does the system of allotment of rooms to freshmen work?</a>
            <div id="faq2" class="faq-content">
                <p>MANIT follows pretty good system for allotting rooms to freshmen. Hostel Authority randomly allot the rooms and the roommates are decided in order of their registration in the hostel. Generally 4 people have to share one room alongwith cupboards. In rare cases, it may be 3 people sharing one room. The reason to adopt this system is that the students should interact more with their roommates and other new students. It is helpful for one gets to know his/her batchmate. Learn other's culture and language ,if they belong to some other state or country. Moreover, it helps cultivate new bonds of friendship.</p>

            <a class="faq-section-title" href="#faq4">Where do we get textbooks from?</a>
            <div id="faq4" class="faq-content">
                <p>It makes sense to wait a couple of days for the professor to specify which books they will be following. Although, hardly any changes are there and you can ask your seniors which books to recommend. 
Here are the ways to get text books:
1) They are issued at the institute library after your card is issued. You can get the form online and submit it with your photograph and admission card to get your library card. 
2) There are book bank at MANIT. You can issue twice from book banks per year. Books are issued for a semester's duration. Issuing books from book bank requires form fillings each year. Priority on the basis of category is given. (SC/ST >OBC > GEN) 
3) You may also borrow books from seniors or purchase from them at half rate. Seniors are usually keen to give out books. 
4) You may purchase books from the retailers from local market of Bhopal. They follow a return policy and refund some amount on returning books after a semester is over.</p>

            <a class="faq-section-title" href="#faq5">Tell me more about department change.</a>
            <div id="faq5" class="faq-content">
                <p>MANIT encourages meritorious students by offering the option of a change of department at the end of first year. It depends upon the number of seats available in the quota through which you took admission. This requires a good CGPA at the end of 2nd semester. 
However, you must understand that only a handful of students can get a department change, so don't bank upon getting one and choose a department in which you could plan your career.</p>

            <a class="faq-section-title" href="#faq6">How much would we need to study at Manit?</a>
            <div id="faq6" class="faq-content">
                <p> The amount of study one has to put in varies from individual to individual. 
Proffesors cover all the important topics in their lectures, studying from their notes can fetch you decent marks, but that requires regular attendance. 
If you are aiming for a department change, you probably will have to study a bit more than you usually would. 
Life at NIT is not just about academic excellence but about overall development. There are many workshops held every weekend and various events organised by different societies, in which you must participate.</p>

                <p>
Regarding manit the first question which comes to one's mind is related to ragging. So don't be worried, here we have a concept of zero ragging and at the time of admission you are required to fill an anti ragging form. So the moment you encounter anything you can call at the number given and help will reach you within 10 minutes. But no such problem has been registered in the past few years. 
The next thing about which you may be worried is the medical facilities over here
We have a dispensary and an ambulance available 24*7. Also there are many hospitals nearby. In the campus too we have doctors in case of emergency. 
And now you may be worried about the food? 
So dont worry other than hostel mess, you have a canteen, a cafe, nescafes and amul in the campus itself. Other than this you have many good restaurants and food joints nearby at a distance of a kilometer or two
One may also be worried about the coaching facilities, isn't it?
So manit is located in the city itself and good coaching classes are available nearby. You have buses, autos present just outside the campus and so you can go anywhere easily.</p>
