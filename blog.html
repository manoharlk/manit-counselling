                <p>The first day as we enter the college, the big slope right at the entrance brings a thought in our mind that we are going to be in one of the best places that we have ever been in our lives. The moment we see the beauty of the college, we fall in love with the campus. Big buildings with a green environment and well executed arts in and around architecture department reflect the beauty of the college.</p>
<p>Great help by the seniors during admissions ensures us that we are in a place that provides for a comfortable stay.</p>
<p>~ACADEMICS~</p>
<p>Great sessions of teaching with well experienced lecturers and good technical equipments make a particular student gain good knowledge in the class itself.</p>
<p>Workshops and Labs are good with good infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&zwnj;~HOSTEL AND MESS FACILITIES~</p>
<p>Decent rooms provided in the hostel with 3 people as our room mates literally brings a new family for us. As we make lots of noise with them around, it is like making some great memories to remember for a lifetime.</p>
<p>Coming to the mess, the menu we have is a typical North Indian cuisine and once we get used to it, it will seem fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>~MORE FACILITIES ~</p>
<p>As the campus is located at the centre of the city,</p>
<p>Shopping malls and restaurants are available around the college premises. Travel facilities are good with autos, cabs and buses&nbsp; available 24 * 7.</p>
<p>Good &zwnj;medical facilities are provided by the DISPENSARY in the campus.</p>
<p>Other than these,</p>
<p>&zwnj;MANIT contains more than 25 societies ,every single one is unique in its working. They deal with literary, cultural,technical research aspects and go green forums.</p>
<p>Regarding sports, the college has a SPORTS COMPLEX, providing all the sports facilities for the students.</p>
<p>&zwnj;And finally ,I experienced ZERO RAGGING in Manit regardless of stories about ragging in Manit. You will only find supportive and helpful seniors.</p>
<p>&zwnj;Manit can definitely bring out a great and confident person in you, as it exposes you to many types of people and their varied cultures. Students here are from all over the world.</p>
<p>&zwnj;650 acres of green world can surely help you in attaining peace and concentrating on academics.</p>
<p>A CGPA of around 8 would surely help everyone get a good package during placements.</p>
<p>&zwnj;Finally, what one can say about MANIT is that it is a college which teaches each and every person and enables building ourself as a great individual.</p>
