                    <p>The first day as we enter the college, the big slope right at the entrance brings a thought in our mind that we are going to be in one of the best places that we have ever been in our lives. The moment we see the beauty of the college, we fall in love with the campus. Big buildings with a green environment and well executed arts in and around architecture department reflect the beauty of the college.</p><p>Great help by the seniors during admissions ensures us that we are in a place that provides for a comfortable stay.</p><p>~ACADEMICS~</p><p>Great sessions of teaching with well experienced lecturers and good technical equipments make a particular student gain good knowledge in the class itself.</p><p>Workshops and Labs are good with good infrastructure.&nbsp;</p><p>&zwnj;~HOSTEL AND MESS FACILITIES~</p><p>Decent rooms provided in the hostel with 3 people as our room mates literally brings a new family for us. As we make lots of noise with them around, it is like making some great memories to remember for a lifetime.</p><p>Coming to the mess, the menu we have is a typical North Indian cuisine and once we get used to it, it will seem fine.&nbsp;</p><p>~MORE FACILITIES ~</p><p>As the campus is located at the centre of the city,</p><p>Shopping malls and restaurants are available around the college premises. Travel facilities are good with autos, cabs and buses&nbsp; available 24 * 7.</p><p>Good &zwnj;medical facilities are provided by the DISPENSARY in the campus.</p><p>Other than these,</p><p>&zwnj;MANIT contains more than 25 societies ,every single one is unique in its working. They deal with literary, cultural,technical research aspects and go green forums.</p><p>Regarding sports, the college has a SPORTS COMPLEX, providing all the sports facilities for the students.</p><p>&zwnj;And finally ,I experienced ZERO RAGGING in Manit regardless of stories about ragging in Manit. You will only find supportive and helpful seniors.</p><p>&zwnj;Manit can definitely bring out a great and confident person in you, as it exposes you to many types of people and their varied cultures. Students here are from all over the world.</p><p>&zwnj;650 acres of green world can surely help you in attaining peace and concentrating on academics.</p><p>A CGPA of around 8 would surely help everyone get a good package during placements.</p><p>&zwnj;Finally, what one can say about MANIT is that it is a college which teaches each and every person and enables building ourself as a great individual.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Maulana Azad National Institute Of Technology Bhopal (MACT / MANIT / NIT-Bhopal) was established as an institute of national importance under the NIT-act 2007.It started in 1960 and functionally inaugurated in 1962 by Pt Jawahar Lal Nehru.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The institute is situated in the heart of Bhopal (Mata Mandir) on a beautiful plateau with a verdant 650-acre campus.It has 10 hostels,excellent food and lodging facilities with 24 hour security.MANIT's Computer Center, Canteen, Workshops, Athletic Ground, Sports Complex, Gym, Energy Center and the open air auditorium are the places where students enjoy a competitive yet healthy environment. Life in MANIT is a perfect combination of academics and extra curricular activities. MANIT justifies its logo 'vidhya param bhushanam' i.e; knowledge is the greatest jewel by providing good acedemics and excellent placements. The most exciting moments of life in MANIT are because of the wide variety of student organisations (societies) and the annual fests. It has more than 25 societies like Rashtraay, Pixel ,Drishtant etc. and fests like tooryanaad, maffick, sportsmania which offer ample amount of opportunituies to all students.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Apart from all this Manit&nbsp; gives its students the 'attitude' to handle any problem and the 'confidence' to be different. It develops a student&rsquo;s 'personality'&nbsp; which they will carry throughout their life, leaving them with good friends and sweet memories for life.The best thing about MANIT is "It lets the kid inside you breathe, fly in its full swing, and still, gives one the maturity and affection of a grown-up."&nbsp; Life in MANIT may sometimes be tough , sometimes easy, at times boring and at other times quite exiting but overall life here is beautiful or rather 'Too good to be true!&rsquo; These four years here will probably be the best 4-years of every Manitian!</p>

                    <p>Regarding MANIT the first question which comes to one's mind is ragging. In MANIT, we have a concept of zero ragging and at the time of admission you are required to fill an anti ragging form. A number in case of any emergency will also be provided so that the moment you encounter any kind of ragging, the number given can be dialled and help will be provided. But no such problem has been registered in the past few years.</p>
    <p>The campus has a dispensary with a qualified doctor and an ambulance available 24*7. Also, there are many hospitals in close vicinity of the campus.</p>
    <p>For fooding purposes, other than the hostel mess, there is a canteen, a cafe, Nescafe outlets and an Amul parlour in the campus itself. Other than this there are many good restaurants and food joints nearby at a distance of a kilometer or two.</p>
    <p>MANIT is located in the city itself and good coaching institutes are available nearby. You have buses and autos available just outside the campus to enable movement in and around the city.</p>

                       <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; MANIT for me is not just a college, it&rsquo;s like another world. The first time you enter the college for your enrolment, you will be bewildered with the beauty of the campus. A college usually is a place where you learn your academics and move on. But MANIT is something which made my personality better. My life has two phases now; before MANIT and after coming to MANIT. This is a ragging free campus. MANIT has a good academic schedule and it is strictly followed.We get to witness great placements every year. I personally think MANIT is the place you learn the most from your friends, seniors, the faculty and especially from the societies of MANIT. Every society is aimed to transform you the way you were not before. These societies encourage our interests like music, dance, photography, technical stuff, social service and what not. Finally, if you are good at something, MANIT is going to make you one of the best in it.</p>
